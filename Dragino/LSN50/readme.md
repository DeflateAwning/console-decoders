# LSN50 LoRaWAN Sensor Node

## Overview
LSN50 is a Long Range LoRaWAN Sensor Node. It is designed for outdoor data logging and
powered by Li/SOCl2 battery for long term use and secure data transmission. It is designed
to facilitate developers to quickly deploy industrial level LoRa and IoT solutions. It helps
users to turn the idea into a practical application and make the Internet of Things a reality. It
is easy to program, create and connect your things everywhere.
It is based on SX1276/SX1278 allows the user to send data and reach extremely long ranges
at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high
interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption. It targets professional
wireless sensor network applications such as irrigation systems, smart metering, smart cities,
smartphone detection, building automation, and so on.
LSN50 uses STM32l0x chip from ST, STML0x is the ultra-low-power STM32L072xx
microcontrollers incorporate the connectivity power of the universal serial bus (USB 2.0
crystal-less) with the high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at a
32 MHz frequency, a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories (192
Kbytes of Flash program memory, 6 Kbytes of data EEPROM and 20 Kbytes of RAM) plus an
extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals.
LSN50 is an open source product, it is based on the STM32Cube HAL drivers and lots of
libraries can be found in ST site for rapid development.
