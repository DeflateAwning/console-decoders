# Dragino LoRaWAN GPS Tracker 

## Overview
LGT-92 is a Long Range / low power consumption LoRaWAN GPS tracker. LGT-92 gets user’s
location info via GPS and sends it to IoT server via LoRaWAN wireless network.
Compare to traditional GPS trackers (base on GPRS or Cellular network), LGT-92 use much lower
power consumption hence can last for longer time. It doesn’t need cellular service;
system integrator can build their tracking network base on LoRaWAN technology or Join
the device to existing LoRaWAN network
LGT-92 uses STM32l0x chip from ST, STML0x is the ultra-low-power STM32L072xx
microcontrollers incorporate the connectivity power of the universal serial bus (USB 2.0
crystal-less) with the high-performance ARM® Cortex®-M0+ 32-bit RISC core operating at
a 32 MHz frequency, a memory protection unit (MPU), high-speed embedded memories
(192 Kbytes of Flash program memory, 6 Kbytes of data EEPROM and 20 Kbytes of RAM).
LGT-92 includes a low power GPS module and a 9-axis accelerometer for motion detection. The
power for both of the GPS module can be controlled by MCU to achieve the best energy
profile for different applications.
LGT-92 series products include two major variants:
 LGT-92-LI: is powered by 1000mA rechargeable Li-on battery and charge circuit, which
target for real time tracking with short tracking uplink.
 LGT-92-AA: Disable the charge circuit to get the lowest power consumption and power
directly by 2 x 1.5v AA battery. This is designed for asset tracking where only need to
uplink a few times every day.
LGT-92 is an open source project, it is based on the STM32Cube HAL drivers and lots of libraries
can be found in ST site for rapid development.
