# Dragino LoRaWAN Water Leak Sensorr

## Overview
The Dragino LWL01 is a LoRaWAN Water Leak Sensor. It detects the water leak status and send it
to LoRaWAN network. The LWL01 is small sensor, the dimension is as small as 64 x 30 x 14 mm.
LWL01 is powered by a CR2032 coin battery, in a good LoRaWAN Network Coverage case, it can
transmit as many as 12,000 uplink packets (base on SF7, 14dB). in poor LoRaWAN network
coverage, it can transmit ~ 1,300 uplink packets (base on SF10, 18dB). The design goal for one
battery is up to 2 years. User can easily change the CR2032 battery for reuse.
The LWL01 will send periodically data every day as well as for water leak event. It also count the
water leak event times and also calculate last water leak duration.
Each LWL01 is pre-loaded with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registrations, register these keys
to local LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect after power on.
