# LoRaWAN Water Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LWL02 is a LoRaWAN Water Sensor. When there is water between the two metal
probes, LWL02 indicates a water leak event and uplink to IoT server via LoRaWAN network.

LWL02 is powered by 2 x AAA batteries and target for long time use, these two batteries can
provide about 16,000 ~ 70,000 uplink packets, which result in 2 ~ 10 years battery life. After
battery running out, user can easily open the enclosure and replace with 2 common AAA
batteries.

The LWL02 will send periodically data every day as well as for each water leak event. It also
counts the water leak times and calculate last water leak duration. User can also disable the
uplink for each water leak event, instead, device can count each event and uplink periodically.

Each LWL02 is pre-load with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registration, register these keys to
LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect after power on
