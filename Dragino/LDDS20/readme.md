# LoRaWAN Liquid Level Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LDDS20 is a LoRaWAN Ultrasonic liquid level sensor for Internet of Things
solution. It uses none-contact method to measure the height of liquid in a container without
opening the container, and send the value via LoRaWAN network to IoT Server
The LDDS20 sensor is installed directly below the container to detect the height of the liquid
level. User doesn’t need to open a hole on the container to be tested. The none-contact
measurement makes the measurement safety, easier and possible for some strict situation.
LDDS20 uses ultrasonic sensing technology for distance measurement. LDDS20 is of high
accuracy to measure various liquid such as: toxic substances, strong acids, strong alkalis and
various pure liquids in high-temperature and high-pressure airtight containers.
The LoRa wireless technology used in LDDS20 allows device to send data and reach
extremely long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum
communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.
LDDS20 is powered by 8500mA Li-SOCI2 battery; It is designed for long term use up to 10
years*.
Each LDDS20 pre-loads with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registrations, register these
keys to local LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect if there is network coverage, after
power on.
