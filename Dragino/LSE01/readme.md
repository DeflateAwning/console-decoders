# LoRaWAN Soil Moisture & EC Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LSE01 is a LoRaWAN Soil Moisture & EC Sensor for IoT of Agriculture. It is
designed to measure the soil moisture of saline-alkali soil and loamy soil. The soil sensor
uses FDR method to calculate the soil moisture with the compensation from soil
temperature and conductivity. It also has been calibrated in factory for Mineral soil type.
It detects Soil Moisture, Soil Temperature and Soil Conductivity, and uploads the value via
wireless to LoRaWAN IoT Server.
The LoRa wireless technology used in LES01 allows device to send data and reach extremely
long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication
and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.
LES01 is powered by 4000mA or 8500mAh Li-SOCI2 battery, It is designed for long term use
up to 10 years.
Each LES01 is pre-load with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registrations, register these
keys to local LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect after power on.
