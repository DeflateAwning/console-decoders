# LoRaWAN Soil NPK Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LSNPK01 is a LoRaWAN Soil NPK Sensor for IoT of Agriculture. It is designed to
measure the Soil Fertility Nutrient and provide a plant growing reference. The probe is IP68
waterproof and can be buried into soil for long term use.

LSNPK01 detects soilâ€™s Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium use TDR method, and uploads
these values via wireless to LoRaWAN IoT Server.

The LoRa wireless technology used in LSNPK01 allows device to send data and reach
extremely long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum
communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.
LSNPK01 is powered by 8500mAh Li-SOCI2 battery, it is designed for long term use up to 5
years.

Each LSNPK01 is pre-load with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registrations, register these
keys to local LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect after power on.
