# LoRaWAN Door Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LDS01 is a LoRaWAN Door Sensor. It detects door open/close status and uplink to
LoRaWAN network. The LDS01 is small sensor; the dimension is as small as 64 x 30 x 14 mm.

LDS01 is powered by a CR2032 coin battery, in a good LoRaWAN Network Coverage case, it can
transmit as many as 12,000 uplink packets (base on SF7, 14dB). in poor LoRaWAN network
coverage, it can transmit ~ 1,300 uplink packets (base on SF10, 18dB). The design goal for one
battery is up to 1 year. User can easily change the CR2032 battery for reuse.

The LDS01 will send periodically data every day as well as for each door open/close action. It also
counts the door open times and calculate last door open duration.

Each LDS01 is pre-loaded with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registrations, register these keys
to local LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect after power on.
