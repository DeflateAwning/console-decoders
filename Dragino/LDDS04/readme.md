# LoRaWAN 4-Detect-Channels Distance Sensor

## Overview
The Dragino LDDS04 is a LoRaWAN 4-Channels Distance Sensor for Internet of Things
solution. It is capable to add up to four Ultrasonic Sensors to measure four distances at the
same time.
The LDDS04 can be applied to scenarios such as horizontal distance measurement, parking
management system, object proximity and presence detection, intelligent trash can
management system, robot obstacle avoidance, automatic control, sewer, etc.
It detects the distance between the measured object and the sensor, and uploads the value
via wireless to LoRaWAN IoT Server.
The LoRa wireless technology used in LDDS04 allows device to send data and reach
extremely long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum
communication and high interference immunity whilst minimizing current consumption.
LDDS04 is powered by 8500mAh Li-SOCI2 battery, it is designed for long term use up to 5
years.
Each LDDS04 is pre-load with a set of unique keys for LoRaWAN registrations, register these
keys to local LoRaWAN server and it will auto connect after power on.
